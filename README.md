# CCGNN
The code and dataset for our paper: Collaborative Graph Neural Networks with Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation. We have implemented our methods in Pytorch.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.6
- torch 1.7.1
- dgl 0.7.2

## Usage 

### Generate data

You need to run the file ```new_data.py``` to generate the data format needed for our model. The detailed commands 
can be found in ```load_{dataset}.sh```

You need to run the file ```generate_neg.py``` to generate data to speed up the test. You can set the 
data set in the file.

### Training and Testing 

Then you can run the file ```Mynew_main.py``` to train and test our model. 
The detailed commands can be found in ```{dataset}.sh```
